System Requirements:

*	A Windows, Mac or Linux system 
*	Python3 installed
*	Pygame version 1.9.6 installed


Installation Instructions:

*	Open the game folder named “MoonRun”. Within this folder open the file named 		“font.ttf” to install the font onto your system. (This is not required but heavily 	recommended).

*	Within the “MoonRun” folder open the “moonrun.py” file in a Pyhton IDE. This is 	the game file and holds all the classes, functions, game logic and game loop for 	the game. We recommend using Visual Studio Code to run this file in.

*	Finally, execute/run the “moonrun.py” file in your IDE. A game widow will open up 	and provide further instructions on how to play the game.

*	Have fun!
