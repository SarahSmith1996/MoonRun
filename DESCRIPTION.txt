Game Description
 
MoonRun is a 2D side scrolling sci-fi arcade game developed by coolPeeps1. Set on the moon, the 
player takes the role of an astronaut who is tasked to avoid craters, which the player can fall 
through, and meteorites which present as an obstacle to the player. The player can utilise their 
jetpack to avoid craters and meteorites. Additionally, in-game items such as jetpack and speed 
boosts can be collected, providing enhancements to the player. The game is controlled using the 
arrow keys in singleplayer mode. The world is constantly moving hence if the player is too slow and 
out of frame during gameplay, the game is over. Plus, if the player is too fast and out of frame, they 
run the risk of falling into an unseen crater. The objective for the player is to survive as long as 
possible, as the score increases with time in singleplayer. The game keeps track of the five highest 
scores as it features an in-game leaderboard. The game is accompanied by an 8-bit style soundtrack 
and art style, reminiscent of early NES and arcade games. Please see the inspirations section for 
further clarification. The game also features a 2-player mode. The 2nd player is controlled using the 
W, A and S keys. This plays identically to the singleplayer mode, except there is no score tracker. The 
winner is determined by the last player to survive.
 
Inspirations
 
The concept of MoonRun was inspired by the gameplay in the “Dinosaur Game” featured in Google 
Chrome. To clarify, we did not refer to any of its source game code. To get to know some of the 
functionalities of pygame, we referred to a pygame tutorial by Tech with Tim 
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6xMBig-pP4&t=620s). From it, we were inspired to create lists 
to keep track of multiple object instances and iterate through them and implement a jump with a 
quadratic function. As our game is set in space and we wanted to use jetpacks, we had to remodel 
the jump entirely though via a linear rise followed by a ‘quadratic’ fall. Also, we used keyboard input 
as outlined in the tutorial. All sprites were created and drawn by us and there is no reuse of any 
game code. The 8-bit style music featured in the game is free to use under Creative Commons 
Attribution license and all sounds were taken from the free VST library Bitkits. The music is free to 
use under Creative Commons Attribution license and all sounds (except for the jetpack sound which 
we created ourselves with a white noise generator) were taken from the free VST library Bitkits
